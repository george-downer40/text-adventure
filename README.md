## Introduction

I have chosen to create a Python based text-based adventure game for my porfolio project 3. It is largely inspired by traditional fantasy tropes such as Dungeons & Dragons, but also an old children's tv show called Knightmare (insert Wikipedia link). This show had a team of contestants guide another player through a series of rooms in a dungeon / castle, with the team having to describe the room and it's contents to the player. 

This game will guide the user / player through a dungeon, in which they will encounter monsters, traps and a boss. There will be 3 stats used during the game; health, attack and a secret stat called luck. The player will be able to raise and lower these stats through different scenarios encountered in the game. The player will also be able to choose between 3 'classes' at the beginning of the game, which will determine their starting stats. These are the Lord, the Adventurer, and the Vagabond. The Lord will be the easiest version of the game, with the Adventurer and Vagabond being increasingly harder. The game is won if they can pass obstacles in the dungeon and reach the final room. The game is lost if they run out of health, or fall victim to a trap.

### Bugs
While writing the README document, I was unable to see a preview in Gitpod. This meant in order for me to check the layout of my README file, I had to commit each change, push that version, and view the README in the Adventure Game Github Repo.
